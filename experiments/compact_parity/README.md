This experiment is known as g1d in the ANODE paper, or crossing trajectories problem in Dissecting Neural ODEs. The aim is to map 1 to -1, and -1 to 1.
This should be a very simple task, however, for NODEs, due to paths crossing in phase space it is almost impossible.
There are two files, one is for the second order method, the other is for the augmented method.
